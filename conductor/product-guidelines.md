# Product Guidelines

## Brand & Voice
- **Persona:** Maintain the current, established persona perfectly. It acts as an AI Wingman for texting, and its voice should not be altered in the new design.

## Design & Typography
- **Typography:** Utilize "Monospaced Accents" to support the modernized dark tactical look. This provides a tech-forward, precise aesthetic suited for highly structured data presentation like AI advice and chat analysis.
- **Layout System:** Adopt a "Fluid & Organic" layout strategy. This means soft edges and flexible spacing based on content density, ensuring a massive makeover that fixes the previous misalignments and improves cohesion across all components.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **One-Tap Actions:** Minimize steps for core tasks, such as uploading screenshots or generating advice in Quick Mode.
- **Progressive Reveal:** Hide advanced options until needed to keep the initial UI clean and focused on the core flow.
- **Contextual Onboarding:** Explain new UI elements organically as the user interacts with the app, reducing upfront cognitive load.
