# Initial Concept
Rizzbot is an AI-powered texting coach that helps users craft authentic, confident responses. The current focus is a critical overhaul of the mobile UI, specifically targeting the Quick Mode. The goal is to modernize the structure, layout, user flow, and information architecture to fix misalignment and bugs, creating a polished, mobile-first experience with reduced friction while preserving the existing dark tactical design language.

## Target Audience
Individuals seeking relationship and texting advice, looking for quick, actionable suggestions to improve their communication with romantic interests.

## Key Features & Requirements
- **Mobile-First Navigation:** Implementing a Bottom Tab Bar pattern to keep Quick Mode centered and reduce friction when navigating between features.
- **Quick Mode Information Architecture (IA):** Adopting a "Preview-First" approach, placing image previews prominently at the top with floating actions below to improve the user flow.
- **Visual Aesthetic:** Maintaining the current established dark tactical design language but undergoing a massive makeover by redesigning UI elements from scratch to fix misalignments and improve component cohesion.
- **Interactive Polish:** Enhancing the UI to feel "alive" through the use of haptic feedback on actions/success and micro-animations (e.g., smooth transitions, pulsing buttons for AI thinking).
