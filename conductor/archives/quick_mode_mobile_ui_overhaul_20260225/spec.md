# Specification: Quick Mode Mobile UI Overhaul

## Objective
Overhaul Rizzbot's mobile UI, specifically focusing on the Quick Mode, to modernize the structure, layout, user flow, and information architecture while preserving the dark tactical design language. Fix existing misalignments and bugs, and upgrade component composition for cohesion and polish following modern mobile aesthetic patterns.

## Requirements
- **Navigation:** Implement a Bottom Tab Bar to keep Quick Mode central.
- **Quick Mode IA:** Use a Preview-First approach (prominent image preview at the top, floating actions below).
- **Aesthetic:** Maintain the "dark tactical" persona but redesign elements from scratch using a "Fluid & Organic" layout and "Monospaced Accents" typography.
- **Interactions:** Integrate Haptic Feedback and Micro-animations (e.g., pulsing buttons).
- **UX Principles:** One-Tap Actions, Progressive Reveal, and Contextual Onboarding.
